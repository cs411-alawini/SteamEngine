## Project Summary

  We want our project to be a good way for users to find any games they want to play and/or explore data about Steam's library. The main functionality will be a way to search up either the title of a game or identifiers, like the genre of the game, and explore any matches through filters. Our database gives us plenty of different identifiers for the user to search by, like minimum hardware necessary to play the game, reviews, whether the game is casual or not, and many others. Additionally, we want to include an interactive visual to show the breakdown of steam’s library with respect to user-chosen identifiers: for example, if the user wanted to see how much of steam’s library is categorized as RPG and single player, they would be able to see that breakdown via an interactive visual. 
	We also will include functionality to log into an account of some sorts. Features associated with that would include the option to “like” a game and add comments about it for other users to see, as well as save games for future sessions. We also want the user to be able to enter their computer specifications so that we can recommend games their systems are capable of running.
